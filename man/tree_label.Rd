\title{Build element or node label in tree}
\usage{
tree_label(x, val_printer, class_printer, remove_newlines)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A tree like object (list, etc.)}

\item{val_printer}{Function that values get passed to before being drawn to
screen. Can be used to color or generally style output.}

\item{class_printer}{Same as \code{val_printer} but for the the class types of
non-atomic tree elements.}

\item{remove_newlines}{Should character strings with newlines in them have
the newlines removed? Not doing so will mess up the vertical flow of the
tree but may be desired for some use-cases if newline structure is
important to understanding object state.}
}
\description{
These methods control how the value of a given node is printed. New methods
can be added if support is needed for a novel class
}
