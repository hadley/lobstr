\title{Tree printing internal function}
\usage{
tree_internal(
  x,
  x_id = NULL,
  branch_hist = character(0),
  opts,
  attr_mode = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{opts}{All the arguments besides \code{el} from \code{\link{tree}} that
effect output}

\item{attr_mode}{Is this element an attribute element of the parent? This
results in some different printing styles}

\item{el}{Current element to be printed}

\item{branch_chars}{Character vector of branch symbols that are concatenated
together to form current element/row's branch structure when catted to
console. There are a few instances where these symbols are not purely
concatenated involving mostly last children. This is the most tricky logic
to follow in the function}

\item{el_id}{Id of current element (if desired)}
}
\description{
This is the internal function for the main tree printing code. It wraps the
static options arguments from the user-facing \code{tree()} into a single opts
list to make recusive calls cleaner. It also has arguments that as it is
called successively but the end-user shouldn't see or use.
